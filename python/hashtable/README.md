# Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Implement a Hashtable Class.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* add:
    - time `O(1)`
    - space `O(1)`
* get:
    - time `O(1)`
    - space `O(1)`
* contains:
    - time `O(1)`
    - space `O(1)`
* hash:
    - time `O(n)`
    - space `O(1)`

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
* add
    - Arguments: key, value
    - Returns: nothing
    - This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
* contains
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

# Challenge Summary - Code Challenge: Class 33 - Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
### Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure

* Write a function called left join
* Arguments: two hash maps
  * The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  * The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

* Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* time `O(n^2)`
* space `O(n)`
